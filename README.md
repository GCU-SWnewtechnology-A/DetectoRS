Code Execution Manual
if __name__ == "__main__": Part of the open source.py folder.

Image data input folder path
Folder path to return to after detecting images in the model
Set image range
Model name setting

After setting a total of 4 variables, set the path and specify the folder where images will be detected.
Please enter the model when comparing with DetectoRS as well as YOLO and Faster_R_CNN.
